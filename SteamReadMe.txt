[h1]I Don't Want That!  (Prevent Item Transfer)[/h1]


Allows the user to mark items so they are not automatically transferred on the corpse recycle or take all commands.

When on mission, press F9 when hovering over an item to add or remove it to the blacklist.  Press F12 to clear out the blacklist.

The keys are configurable.

The game's normal Ctrl + Click and drag and drop not affected.

[h1]Polish[/h1]

There are a couple of items to be addressed in the next update:
[list]
[*]The "modified" icon (M) is used to indicate if something is blacklisted or not.
This visually conflicts with anything that is found that is actually modified.
I don't know if it's even possible to find a modified item in the field.  This is just a placeholder.
[*]Sometimes the M icon isn't refreshed when marking items and then moving them.  The functionality works, but the UI is not updated.  Closing the inventory and opening it back up will display the correct marks.
[/list]

[h1]Configuration[/h1]

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at [i]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph\QM_LockItemTransfer\config.json[/i].
