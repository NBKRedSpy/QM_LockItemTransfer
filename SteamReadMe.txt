[h1]I Don't Want That!  (Prevent Item Transfer)[/h1]


Allows the user to prevent items from automatically being added to the inventory via the Corpse Recycle and Take All commands.

When on mission, press F9 when hovering over an item to add it to the blacklist.  Press F12 to clear out the blacklist.

The keys are configurable.

The game's normal Ctrl + Click and dragging and dropping are not affected.

There are a couple of items to be addressed in the next update:
[list]
[*]The "modified" icon (M) is used to indicate if something is blacklisted or not.
This visually conflicts with anything that is found that is actually modified.
I don't know if it's even possible to find a modified item in the field.  This is just a placeholder.
[*]Sometimes the M icon isn't refreshed when marking items and then moving them.  The functionality works, but the UI is not updated.  Closing the inventory and opening it back up will display the correct marks.
[/list]
